# MinistryPages
Ministry Pages is an AI-enabled website template for Churches.

## In this directory 
This directory contains our backend service that makes our AI features of migrating an existing website from a URL and generating a post from a sermon video link possible. 

## In the /web directory
The web directory contains our website template. It uses assistant-ui for a chatbot interface with our custom tools, allowing users to do things like update a piece of content on every page of the site, migrate existing sites, and more.

## We'd love it if you tested it out.
